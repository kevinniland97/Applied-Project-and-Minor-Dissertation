# Applied Project and Minor Dissertation - Algorithms Visualizer

**Student:** Kevin Niland

**Project Supervisor:** Martin Kenirons

### Application
This application is a React app that allows users to visualize various different algorithms (currently, only pathfinding algorithms. In the future, sorting algorithms will be added). The user can upload gifs to a database (Firebase) and download them (the end goal would be to add the ability to view other user's gifs in-browser).
